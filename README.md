# About Me

My name is Alex Mooney. I'm a 29 year-old novice web developer from Georgia. I like web development for the feeling I get whenever I build something new. It's always a great feeling whenever I build something and it works. I'm working hard every day to get better so that I can build more complex and interesting things.
